This is a way to design an efficient implementation of a broadcast algorithm. Here I assume a system of nodes which are structured in a network ring topology with the condition of only 1-way communication.

Proof of optimality:

RTP: For n-number of nodes the algorithm has maximum communication steps by O(n).
For n=1: There are 0 communication steps.
For n=2: There is 1 communication step.
For n=k:
