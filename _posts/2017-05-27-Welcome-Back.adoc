:hp-alt-title: Welcome Back!

As you can see I am using a new blog renderer. It's called http://hubpress.io/[Hubpress] as in Wordpress :). I chose to move away from Skinny Bones because I have been crazy busy and I was not happy with the default configuration. This new tech is a lot more slick to use and even comes with an Admin panel which is powered by the GitHub api. 

I have lots of posts I have been holding off on writing up because of the work involved with the previous iteration of my blog site. Here there is less dev and more learning how this all fits together. I've just seen that there does not seem to be any spell check which is interesting ...

The interactive web editor is pretty cool and allows the user to save drafts and preview current content which is handy.

I am doing my first postgraduate degree at the moment so I am coding, writing and studying far more than ever before. However I want to get my online profile out there for future opportunities. 

I have a lot of old projects that I would like to write up but put in their own archive area of the blog. I would also like to have a filter function for posts ... I see there is one on the admin side. If I can't find built in options I'll add them as I go.

Finally getting this thing off the ground, only three years late! ;)
